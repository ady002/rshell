#rshell
A command shell written in C++.

All single commands without a connector(;, &&, ||, #) works with all tested cases.

Commands with a variety of connectors work. &&'s chained with ||'s work as well as commands chained with ;.

Exit command works. When using the script commands in test cases, need to type exit multiple times,
but outside of script, exit is flawless as tested with script command.

Commands with comments work as tested.

#Limitations
- cannot run sh scripts
- no cd yet
- no piping yet
- seem to output only execute errors

#Bugs
No bugs currently found as tested. Readme updated when bugs are found.
